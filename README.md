# React useEffect Hook Missing Cleanup Function
This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications involving the useEffect hook: missing a cleanup function.  The missing cleanup function can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior, especially when fetching data or subscribing to external resources.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file contains a component that fetches data using `fetch` within the `useEffect` hook. However, it lacks a return statement within `useEffect` to perform cleanup. This means that when the component unmounts, the asynchronous fetch operation might not be canceled, potentially leading to memory leaks if the component is frequently remounted.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code. It includes a return function in the `useEffect` hook which cleans up any ongoing operations such as canceling requests or unsubscribing from events. This ensures that resources are properly released when the component unmounts.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the code with the error.
3. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected code.
4. Run both js files separately using a React development environment to observe the difference in behavior, especially in scenarios with frequent component unmounts and remounts.
